# react-aspnet-core-app
A starting point for an app with a React frontend and ASP.NET Core 2.2 API backend.

Based on the `dotnet react` template with updated packages (including React 16.9.0).

Also includes a partially implemented example of using [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a React component using Test-Driven Development (see *FetchData.test.js*).
